== Changelog ==
= 3.19.4 =
* Fix: Fixed a bug with group videos not displaying for some feeds.
* Fix: Fixed an issue with past events in group feeds due to a Facebook API change which removed the time_filter field.

= 3.19.3 =
* New: In this update, the plugin will now use a persistent cache to store your Facebook group posts. This will help minimize any affects of a Facebook API change on May 25th which will only allow Facebook Groups to retrieve content from the past 90 days. The plugin will store your group posts in the persistent cache so that those posts can continue to be displayed beyond 90 days. This update will also make a one-time request to get the last 100 posts from your group and store those too, so that the affect of this change will be minimal for our users. Please [see here](https://smashballoon.com/doc/facebook-api-change-limits-groups-to-90-days/) for more information.

After this feature has been active for awhile, a "Feed Finder" link will appear under your connected accounts on the plugin Settings page which allows you to see a list of all feeds on your site along with their locations.
* New: Improved the error reporting system to make resolving issues easier.
* Tweak: Due to an API bug which Facebook hasn't resolved yet that affects buy/sell posts in groups, we have added a 'salesposts' shortcode option which will work around the issue until they fix it. If you are displaying posts from a group and receiving an "API Error 100" notice then adding salesposts=true to your shortcode and clearing the plugin cache should resolve the issue.
* Tweak: Added an ISO 8601 standard date format option for post dates and event dates.

If you experience any issues with this update then please open a support ticket [here](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/support/) so that we can address it right away. Thank you!

* Fix: Added image resizing information to the plugin System Info to help with debugging issues.

= 3.16 =
* New: Added support for Facebook oEmbeds. When you share a link to a Facebook post or video, WordPress automatically converts it into an embedded Facebook post for you (an "oEmbed"). However, on October 24, 2020, WordPress is discontinuing support for Facebook oEmbeds and so any existing or new embeds will no longer work. Don't worry though, we have your back! This update adds support for Facebook oEmbeds and so, after updating, the Custom Facebook Feed plugin will automatically keep your oEmbeds working. It will also power any new oEmbeds you post going forward.

= 3.15 =
* New: Added compatibility with our new [Social Wall](http://smashballoon.com/social-wall/?utm_source=plugin-pro&utm_campaign=cff&utm_medium=readme) plugin, which allows you to combine feeds from Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube into one social media "wall". If you are using our Smash Balloon All-Access Bundle then the Social Wall plugin is included at no additional cost. Just log into your account to download and install the plugin.

* Fix: Fixed some stray PHP notices if the Multifeed extension is being used due to the PPCA error check in the previous update.

= 3.14 =
* Important: Due to upcoming Facebook API changes on September 4, 2020, it will only be possible to display feeds from Facebook pages which you are an admin of. If a PPCA Error notice is displayed above your feed then this change will affect one or more of your feeds. For more information about this change, please [see here](https://smashballoon.com/facebook-api-changes-september-4-2020/).
* New: As Facebook only provides large image sizes in their API for timeline feeds then it often results in images being displayed in your feed which are much larger than needed. With this update, the plugin will now create resized versions of the larger images and store them locally on your server. It will then detect the width of your feed and select the optimal sized images to display. Storing resized images is enabled by default but can be disabled in the following location: Facebook Feed > Customize > Misc > Image Resizing.  The plugin uses sizes of 130px, 250px, 400px, and 720px, but this can be customized by using the [cff_resized_image_sizes](https://smashballoon.com/specifying-exact-image-sizes-using-the-cff_resized_image_sizes-filter/) filter.

* Fix: Fixed an bug where images inside an album would not be displayed at full size.

= 3.13.1 =
* Fix: New JavaScript code was not being applied for new visual header layout setting due to caching of old JavaScript file.
* Fix: Carousel extension was not working in version 3.13.
* Fix: Removed screen reader text that was causing layout issues.

The plugin will send a report in the background once per week with your plugin settings and basic information about your website environment. No personal or sensitive data is collected (such as email addresses, Facebook account information, license keys, etc).

See [here](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/docs/usage-tracking/) for more information.
